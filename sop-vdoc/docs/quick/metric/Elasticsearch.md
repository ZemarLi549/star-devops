# Elasticsearch
## 配置

- 前置条件

  - ElasticSearch 版本 >= 6.0.0

  - ElasticSearch 默认采集 `Node Stats` 指标，如果需要采集 `Cluster-Health` 相关指标，需要设置 `cluster_health = true`

  - 设置

     

    ```
    cluster_health = true
    ```

     

    可产生如下指标集

    - `elasticsearch_cluster_health`

  - 设置

     

    ```
    cluster_stats = true
    ```

     

    可产生如下指标集

    - `elasticsearch_cluster_stats`

  ### 用户权限配置

  如果开启账号密码访问，需要配置相应的权限，否则会导致监控信息获取失败错误。

  目前支持 Elasticsearch、Open Distro for Elasticsearch 和 OpenSearch。

  #### Elasticsearch

  - 创建角色 `monitor`，设置如下权限

  ```
  POST /_security/role/monitor
  {
    "applications": [],
    "cluster": [
        "monitor"
    ],
    "indices": [
        {
            "allow_restricted_indices": false,
            "names": [
                "*"
            ],
            "privileges": [
                "manage_ilm",
                "monitor"
            ]
        }
    ],
    "run_as": []
  }
  ```

  - 创建自定义用户，并赋予新创建的 `monitor` 角色。
  - 其他信息请参考配置文件说明

  #### Open Distro for ElasticSearch

  - 创建用户
  - 创建角色 `monitor`，设置如下权限：

  ```
  PUT _opendistro/_security/api/roles/monitor
  {
    "description": "monitor es cluster",
    "cluster_permissions": [
      "cluster:admin/opendistro/ism/managedindex/explain",
      "cluster_monitor",
      "cluster_composite_ops_ro"
    ],
    "index_permissions": [
      {
        "index_patterns": [
          "*"
        ],
        "fls": [],
        "masked_fields": [],
        "allowed_actions": [
          "read",
          "indices_monitor"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "tenant_permissions": []
  }
  ```

  - 设置角色与用户之间的映射关系

  #### OpenSearch

  - 创建用户
  - 创建角色 `monitor`，设置如下权限：

  ```
  PUT _plugins/_security/api/roles/monitor
  {
    "description": "monitor es cluster",
    "cluster_permissions": [
      "cluster:admin/opendistro/ism/managedindex/explain",
      "cluster_monitor",
      "cluster_composite_ops_ro"
    ],
    "index_permissions": [
      {
        "index_patterns": [
          "*"
        ],
        "fls": [],
        "masked_fields": [],
        "allowed_actions": [
          "read",
          "indices_monitor"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "tenant_permissions": []
  }
  ```

  - 设置角色与用户之间的映射关系

#### 采集配置
在数据接入页面选择采集的机器，修改其中配置即可。其它使用默认配置
```text
[[inputs.elasticsearch]]
  # 是否启用该input
  enable_input = true

  ## Elasticsearch服务器配置
  # 支持Basic认证:
  # servers = ["http://user:pass@localhost:9200"]
  servers = ["http://localhost:9200"]

  ## 设置为true可以采集cluster health
  cluster_health = true

  ## 设置为true时可以采集cluster stats.
  cluster_stats = true
```

#### 集群采集配置
调整servers接入多个节点
```text
[[inputs.elasticsearch]]
  # 是否启用该input
  enable_input = true

  ## Elasticsearch服务器配置
  # 支持Basic认证:
  # servers = ["http://user:pass@localhost:9200"]
  servers = ["http://localhost:9200","http://localhost:9200","http://localhost:9200"]

  ## 设置为true可以采集cluster health
  cluster_health = true

  ## 设置为true时可以采集cluster stats.
  cluster_stats = true
```

### 指标
  

以下所有数据采集，默认会追加名为 `host` 的全局 tag（tag 值为 datasleuth所在主机名），也可以在配置中通过 `[inputs.elasticsearch.tags]` 指定其它标签：

```
[inputs.elasticsearch.tags]
# some_tag = "some_value"
# more_tag = "some_other_value"
# ...
```
