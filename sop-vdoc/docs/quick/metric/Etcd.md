# Etcd
## 配置

### 前置条件

etcd 版本 >= 3, 已测试的版本：

- 3.5.7
- 3.4.24
- 3.3.27

开启 etcd，默认的 metrics 接口是 `http://localhost:2379/metrics`，也可以自行在配置文件中修改。

### 采集配置
在指标接入页面修改相关配置。其它使用默认配置即可，其中自定义标签cluster_name作为集群分组标签
```text
[[inputs.prom]]
  # 是否启用该input
  enable_input = true

  urls = ["http://127.0.0.1:2379/metrics"]

  # 自定义标签，修改cluster_name，将作为监控视图变量
  [inputs.prom.tags]
  cluster_name="default_cluster_name"
```

### 集群采集配置
在指标接入页面修改相关配置。urls配置多个节点，其它使用默认配置即可
```text
[[inputs.prom]]
  # 是否启用该input
  enable_input = true

  urls = ["http://127.0.0.1:2379/metrics","http://127.0.0.1:2379/metrics","http://127.0.0.1:2379/metrics"]
```
