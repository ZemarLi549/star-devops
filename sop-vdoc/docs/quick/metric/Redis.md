# Redis
Redis 指标采集器，采集以下数据：

- 开启 AOF 数据持久化，会收集相关指标
- RDB 数据持久化指标
- Slow Log 监控指标
- Big Key scan 监控
- 主从 Replication

## 配置

已测试的版本：

- 7.0.11
- 6.2.12
- 6.0.8
- 5.0.14
- 4.0.14

### 前置条件

- 在采集主从架构下数据时，请配置从节点的主机信息进行数据采集，可以得到主从相关的指标信息。
- 创建监控用户（**可选**）：redis 6.0+ 进入 `redis-cli` 命令行，创建用户并且授权：

```
ACL SETUSER username >password
ACL SETUSER username on +@dangerous +ping
```

- 授权统计 `hotkey/bigkey` 信息，进入 `redis-cli` 命令行：

```
CONFIG SET maxmemory-policy allkeys-lfu
ACL SETUSER username on +get +@read +@connection +@keyspace ~*
```

- 远程采集 hotkey & `bigkey` 需要安装 redis-cli （本机采集时，redis-server 已经包含了 redis-cli）：

```
# ubuntu 
apt-get install redis-tools

# centos
yum install -y  redis
```

### 采集器配置

在指标接入页面修改相关配置。

> ***Attention:***
>
> 如果是阿里云 Redis，且设置了对应的用户名密码，conf 中的 `<PASSWORD>` 应该设置成 `your-user:your-password`，如 `datasleuth:Pa55W0rd`



## 指标

以下所有数据采集，默认会追加名为 `host` 的全局 tag（tag 值为 datasleuth所在主机名），也可以在配置中通过 `[inputs.redis.tags]` 指定其它标签：

```
 [inputs.redis.tags]
  # some_tag = "some_value"
  # more_tag = "some_other_value"
  # ...
```
