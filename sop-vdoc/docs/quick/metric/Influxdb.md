# Influxdb
## 配置

## InfluxDB 采集器配置

### 前置条件

- InfluxDB 采集器，仅适用于 InfluxDB v1.x
- InfluxDB v2.x ，需要使用 prom 采集器进行采集

已测试的版本：

- 1.8.10

### 采集器配置
在数据接入页面选择采集的机器，修改其中配置即可。其它使用默认配置，其中自定义标签cluster_name作为集群分组标签

```
[[inputs.influxdb]]
  # 启用配置
  enable_input = true
  
  url = "http://localhost:8086/debug/vars"

  ## Username and password to send using HTTP Basic Authentication.
  # username = ""
  # password = ""

  # 指标接入默认采集配置，增加cluster_name
  [inputs.influxdb.tags]
  cluster_name = "metric_cluster_name"
```

### 集群采集配置
复制[[inputs.influxdb]]采集不同节点，其它使用默认配置
```text
[[inputs.influxdb]]
  enable_input = true
  url = "http://127.0.0.1:8086/debug/vars"
[[inputs.influxdb]]
  enable_input = true
  url = "http://127.0.0.1:8086/debug/vars"
[[inputs.influxdb]]
  enable_input = true
  url = "http://127.0.0.1:8086/debug/vars"
```


### InfluxDB v2.x

```
[[inputs.prom]]
  ## Exporter HTTP URL.
  url = "http://127.0.0.1:8086/metrics"

  metric_types = ["counter", "gauge"]

  interval = "10s"

  ## TLS configuration.
  tls_open = false
  # tls_ca = "/tmp/ca.crt"
  # tls_cert = "/tmp/peer.crt"
  # tls_key = "/tmp/peer.key"

  [[inputs.prom.measurements]]
    prefix = "boltdb_"
    name = "influxdb_v2_boltdb"

  [[inputs.prom.measurements]]
    prefix = "go_"
    name = "influxdb_v2_go"

  ## Histogram type.
  # [[inputs.prom.measurements]]
  #   prefix = "http_api_request_"
  #   name = "influxdb_v2_http_request"

  [[inputs.prom.measurements]]
    prefix = "influxdb_"
    name = "influxdb_v2"

  [[inputs.prom.measurements]]
    prefix = "service_"
    name = "influxdb_v2_service"

  [[inputs.prom.measurements]]
    prefix = "task_"
    name = "influxdb_v2_task" 

  ## Customize tags.
  [inputs.prom.tags]
  # some_tag = "some_value"
  # more_tag = "some_other_value"
```

## 指标

以下所有数据采集，默认会追加名为 `host` 的全局 tag（tag 值为 datasleuth 所在主机名），也可以在配置中通过 `[inputs.influxdb.tags]` 指定其它标签：

```
 [inputs.influxdb.tags]
  # some_tag = "some_value"
  # more_tag = "some_other_value"
  # ...
```
