# Memcached
## 配置

### 前置条件

- Memcached 版本 >=

   

  ```
  1.5.0
  ```

  。已测试的版本：

  - 1.5.x
  - 1.6.x

在指标接入页面修改配置；集群接入则将servers配置多个节点地址
```text
[[inputs.memcached]]
  # 是否启用该input
  enable_input = true

  ## 服务器地址，可支持多个
  servers = ["localhost:11211"]
  
  # 自定义标签，修改cluster_name，将作为监控视图变量
  [inputs.memcached.tags]
   cluster_name="default_cluster_name"
```

## 指标

以下所有数据采集，默认会追加名为 `host` 的全局 tag（tag 值为 datasleuth 所在主机名），也可以在配置中通过 `[inputs.memcached.tags]` 指定其它标签：

```
 [inputs.memcached.tags]
  # some_tag = "some_value"
  # more_tag = "some_other_value"
  # ...
```
