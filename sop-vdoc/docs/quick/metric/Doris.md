# Doris
## 配置

### 前置条件

Doris 默认开启 Prometheus 端口

验证前端：curl ip:8030/metrics

验证后端：curl ip:8040/metrics

### 采集器配置

在数据接入页面接入Doris采集配置，Doris的前端数据和后端数据是两个接口提供，因此url要配置两个,自定义标签cluster_name作为集群分组标签

  ```
  [[inputs.prom]]
  # 是否启用该input
  enable_input = true

  # Exporter URLs.
  urls = ["http://127.0.0.1:8030/metrics","http://127.0.0.1:8040/metrics"]

  # 自定义标签，修改cluster_name，将作为监控视图变量
  [inputs.prom.tags]
  cluster_name="default_cluster_name"
  ```
